  This is a prototype for Smart India Hackathon 2025.

  Problem Statement ID - 25035

  Problem Statement Title - Sentiment analysis of comments received through E-consultation module

  Expected Outcome

  The intention is to discern the feedback received from the stakeholders through the following:
• Sentiment analysis
• Summary generation
• Word cloud

The solution should considerably reduce the effort of the end user in analysing a high volume of comments. It should be able to clearly identify the sentiments of comments individually as well as broadly overall. The summary generation should be accurate and convey the meaning of the comment properly, in a precise manner. The word cloud feature should showcase the density of the words used by all users.
